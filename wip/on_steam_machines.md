Valve first announced their plans for Steam Machines and SteamOS back in late 2013. The XBone and PS4 had just launch abed and were heavily scrutinized for their lack of backwards compatibility and inability to achieve their promise of 1080p 60fps gaming. Nintendo's Wii U was not viewed as an alternative due to it's significantly lower performance and non-existant third-party support. The market seemed ready for a new competitor. Steam Machines were an excellent Idea with so much promise that will result in complete and utter failure because of poor management and planning by Valve. For those who don't already know, Steam Machines are a class of computer designed to run SteamOS and be a set-top box, similar to a PS4 or XBone. The operating system and hardware are open, so a user can upgrade their machine as they want, and, developers/publishers don't have to stick to Steam as the distribution method. It is intended to be a PC streamlined for the living room. However, it seems increasingly unlikely that Steam Machines will ever take off for a few reasons: the current generation of consoles has had too much time to establish themselves in the market, the hardware is not competitively priced when compared to the current console generation, the platform does nothing to address the complexity of PC gaming, and finally, it offers a limited quantity of games.

It is currently early 2015, and Steam Machines are still six months away. The XBone and PS4 have been out for two years and have managed to sell a significant number of units while gaining a large software library. Launching a new console competitor now
