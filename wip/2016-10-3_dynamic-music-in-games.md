With the recent release of Doom 2016's soundtrack, I felt that it was time to look at one of the most severely
under appreciated aspects of video games: the soundtrack. Like in movies, a good soundtrack matches the tone of the
game and helps get the player in the proper mindset and prime them to feel certain ways. For example, survival
horror games tend to have very subtle ambient music throughout most of the game, building up a sense of tension
until the big scare happens where the music will suddenly switch to loud, jarring notes just like in any good
horror film.


Video games have been using music to set the tone as long as the technology has allowed them to. The NES was the
first console which had the capacity to play complex enough sounds in sequence to make music, and it didn't take
long for developers to utilize that capability to improve the experience for the player. It wasn't quite possible
to have dynamic music at the time, but, developers began to pick music to match the overall tone of each stage.
Take Megaman II for example: It isn't difficult to hear the industrial and hard rock influence on Metal Man's stage
theme.

The gameplay of the stage matches the tone of the music perfectly. Megaman is always in motion, moving conveyor
belts dragging him left and right constantly as enemies engage him across the screen nearly at all times.


Then, take Bubble Man's Theme

Bubble Man's stage is a far-cry from Metal Man's, and the difference in the music shows. Instead of a constant
fight against moving platforms and constantly shooting enemies, the biggest nuisance in Bubble Man's stage is the
spikes and difficult jumps. This is reflected in the more laid back, and almost calming atmosphere. The song is
almost playful and jumpy, taking a bit of the edge off of quite a few of the difficult jumps in the stage.


And it's impossible to talk about Mega Man II without mentioning the famous Wily Castle 1 & 2 theme:

This theme is so well know because it's both awesome to listen to and perfectly sets the tone for the final stretch
of the game. It's triumphant, with his goal in sight, Megaman charges forward towards the final boss. It's ominous,
with certain parts creating a sense of dread of the difficult challenge ahead. It's upbeat, creating a powerful
sense of confidence in the player, pumping them up for the rest of the gauntlet.


As technology improved, it became possible to store enough music on a cartage to have more dynamic music which
changed to fit what was happening on screen more effectively.


TODO: Example from the 16-Bit Era


By the late 1990's, it was computationally possible to easily store and process vast amounts of audio data,
allowing for game soundtracks to become more vibrant and advanced once more. With compact disks it was possible to
stream recorded music in-game.
