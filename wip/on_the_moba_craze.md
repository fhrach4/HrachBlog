Since League of Legends became one of the most played games in the world with over 20 million players, there has been a noticeable trend in multiplayer games to include many of the mechanics commonly found in MOBAs into other genres. Most notably Blizzards's first FPS Overwatch appears to be a hybrid of a class-based shooter with a MOBA along with Battleborn by GearBox Software, both of which are due out later this year. Class-based shooters are certainly not anything new, but the most recent wave has incorporated some unique elements which would be right at home in League of Legends or DOTA2.

I have not played it yet, but Overwatch appears to be a pretty standard class-based shooter except for a few key differences: the player 'locks in' to a hero and cannot switch mid-game, and, each hero has unique abilities which appear to be on a cooldown timer or based on a certain amount of damage done/absorbed etc.
