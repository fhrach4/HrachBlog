I never update this blog, ever. That needs to change. Due to various reasons which I will not get into at the moment, I am currently placed in the CRP program at RIT due to difficulties with academic performance in the last year or so. While I was initially not thrilled, perhaps even resistant, to the couple of classes I was being forced to take, I'm beginning to feel like at least one of them will be a positive influence. I was expecting to have motivation and wellness, but it might actually provide the kick in the pants I need to start making changes in my life. One easy change is the [30 Day Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNP03fDSj1U) from a TED talk by Matt Cutts.


The gist of the 30 Day Challenge is based off of the assertion that it takes the average human 30 days to create a habit. I have no idea if this is true or not, or if it's even based on any research, but there is certainly no harm in trying to make a change and stick with it for 30 days. Needless to say, the change I decided to attempt was to update this neglected website that I'm paying for. I figure the worst that can happen is that I actually use the damn thing, so, there is certainly no reason not to at least attempt this.

Either way, look forward to this actually being updated for once, I suppose.
