Advertisements make the world wide web as we know it possible. This is a truth that most don't like to hear,
however, don't mistake this sentiment as judgement for using an ad-blocker. There are plenty of legitimate reasons
to use one, ranging from protecting your system from malicious code, to making websites usable, increasing the
page-load speed and overall responsiveness, or simply to protect your datacap. It's pretty much accepted that the
modern web is nearly impossible to use without software to block ads, and it is fully in the user's right to block
content from being displayed on *their* system. However, it is in all of our best interests for the web to remain
free and open, and sadly, no one has come up with an acceptable alternative beyond selling ad-space.


I believe, however, a balance can be struck. While I am adamantly against Ad Block Plus's
[acceptable advertising campaign](https://adblockplus.org/acceptable-ads#criteria-general), I believe a set of
guidelines like they outline has merit. The major flaw with the system ABP as in place is they act as the final
arbiter of what is acceptable and what is not, and, they reserve the right to replace content on the screen with
their own. So, if your ad-network is not on their list, they will replace the element with their own content.
Frankly, it reminds me of a Mafia-style shakedown: "That's a real nice pageview you have there... it would be a
shame if someone were to... block it. Pay us to have your ad-network white-listed... or we might have to block your
content... see?" Perhaps that's a bit hyperbolic, but it doesn't sit well with me when the company making money
off of selling the space is also determining what is acceptable and reserve the right to change content at any time
without the page-owner's or users direct content.


However, I believe that an acceptable advertising standard could be a very good thing if it is administered by a
neutral third party, perhaps a group of ad-networks, or many major web-hosters. They could set standards such as:

* Content must be less than 2MB in size
* Content must not add more than 200ms of time to a fresh pageload
* Scripts should be limited to the bare minimum required to track and serve the advertisement
* Video ads should be limited to 5 seconds long
* Content must not obscure the screen or other elements in the page in any way
* Content must not be deceptive, and try and mimic system messages


Obviously, these guidelines would be much more deeply thought out and nuanced then what is listed above, however,
the important prat is that no one should profit from the guidelines; they should be drafted and managed by a
neutral third party, or, enough competing corporations be involved that no one can swing the guidelines in their
favor. Perhaps the W3C should consider drafting this standard, officially securing its neutrality. Either way, food
for thought.
