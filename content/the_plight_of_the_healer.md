Title: The Plight of the Healer

The healer class... also known as the team gimp of the online gaming world. When a team wins in a MOBA, or more recently, in Overwatch, the offense classes generally get the glory - the flankers, the tanks, the AD-Carry, the Nukers. However, when the team loses, blame quickly shifts to the healer. "Why didn't you heal me?", "Where were you the entire match?", and  "Way to go healer". As someone who tends to play support this is infuriating because it's no one's fault when a team loses. A team can fail for any number of reasons, but usually it's because the offense and support don't work together.

A healer is no good if there is no one around to heal, and likewise, an attacker isn't going to be very effective if they need to seek out health pickups constantly. A good team works together, the offense not straying too far from the healer so they can actually keep them alive, and, the offense can also protect the vulnerable healer from the enemy team- after all, dead supports don't heal. I bring this up because 99% of the time I get yelled at for being a bad healer, it's by an asshole who is so far out of position behind the enemy lines that it's impossible to even get to them. And, if I can get just one more good game because of someone reading this post, I'll be happy.
